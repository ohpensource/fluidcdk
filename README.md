# FluidCDK

FluidCDK is a [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) wrapper for [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)  (CloudFormation Development Kit). It can drastically reduce the amount of code required to provision resources in AWS.

## Features

* Enhanced readability over YAML/JSON.
* Structures/props are not required.
* Easy permission grants.
* Tons of built-in day-to-day constructs.
* CDK native objects can still be accessed.
* SOLID design.
